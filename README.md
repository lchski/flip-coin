# Coin Flip Simulator
#### It's like flipping burgers, but cooler!

This program simulates a coin flip a certain number of times and then displays the results. It also does some very basic analysis on the flips.

Command line arguments are included to bypass the simple CLI:

```
--amount: Number of times to run the simulation. Example usage: --amount 100
--log: Name of logfile. Example usage: --log log.txt
--verbose: To show or not to show visual output. Example usage: --verbose
```

## TODO

* Estimated completion time based on 10000 (TBD) simulated flips.
* Improve command line arguments to be less stupid. Specifically....
* Add a logfile switch.
* Change output to be a true switch.
* Comment code
* Refactor code
